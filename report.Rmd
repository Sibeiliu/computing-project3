# Introduction
## COVID-19
Since it‘s first outbreak in January, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly through China and expanded to touch nearly every corner of the globe. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have been sickened and over 200,000 have died. Efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic are now the top priority of governments. To make scientific decisions, such as quarantine, active monitoring, border controls, and lockdown, it is particularly crucial for policymakers to accurately predict how the spread of COVID-19 will change over time. 

A logistic growth curve can be an effective way to capture the trajectory of cumulative cases  of COVID-19. Characterized by an S-shaped curve, logistic growth model is approximately exponential at first, and growth rate  accelerates as it approaches the midpoint of the curve but  begins to decelerate as it approaches the model’s upper bound, called the carrying capacity.
In the COVID-19 case, The more people who have the virus, the more rapidly it spreads, and the growth will necessarily diminish  when everybody is sick, which make the logistic model a good one to study the spread. In particular, this maximum limit would be the maximum number of cases a region can reach denoted by a. The t is the days since the first infection found. The b is the growth rate. And the c is the mid-point when the cumulative cases reach a/2.

$$f(t)=\frac{a}{1+exp{-b(t-c)}}$$

## Objectives
To help predict future spread of  Covid-19 and to identify risk factors, our project aims to fit a logistic curve to the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases in each region of the world by developing an optimization algorithm and implement  K-mean and Gaussian mixture model
 (with EM algorithm) to cluster these curves based on the fitted parameters. 

## Dataset 
The dataset is a a subset of the open data, which contains the cumulative number of confirmed cases and death of COVID-19 from Jan 21 to March 24 from 163 countries/regions. Eight variables are recorded as following: 

* Id: Record ID
* Province/State:   The lcoal state/province of the record; 
* Country/Region:  The country/regiono of the record;
* Lat: Lattudiute of the record;
* Long: Longitude of the record;
* Date: Date of the record; 
* ConfirmedCases: The number of confirmed case on that day;
* Fatalities: The number of death on that day;

We filter the countries that have confirmed cases greater 20 to fit the logistic curve. So in total only 116 coutries are used.

# Statistical Methods 

## Adam Algorithm
Adam is A Method for Stochastic Optimization proposed in 2015 from Diederik P Kingma that only need the first-order gradient. The Stochastic Gradient descent (SGD) is often used when the objective function is typically non-convex (as in our case). The "Ada" is derived from "adaptive", meaning this method change the learning rate over time according to gradients before. The detailed proof and explanation can be found in Diederik's paper. Here we just extracted the fake code part from original paper to clarify. 

Algorithm: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reqiured: $\alpha$: Stepsize \\ $\beta_1,\beta_2\in[0,1)$: Exponential decay rates for the moment estimates\\ $f(\boldsymbol\theta)$ : The objective function with parameter vetctor $\boldsymbol \theta$\\$\epsilon$ controls the converge
\item Required: $\boldsymbol\theta_0$: Initial guess of parameters \\
      $\mathbf m_0\leftarrow \mathbf0$: Initialize the 1st moment vector as $\mathbf 0$\\
      $\mathbf v_0\leftarrow \mathbf0$: Initialize the 1st moment vector as $\mathbf 0$\\
      $t\leftarrow0$:Initialize time step =0\\
      while $\boldsymbol\theta_t-\boldsymbol\theta_{t-1}>\epsilon$ not converge, do\\
         \ \ \ $t\leftarrow t+1$\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol g_t\leftarrow \nabla_{\theta}f_{t}(\boldsymbol\theta_{t-1})$: Get gradients w.r.t objective function at timestep $t$\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol  m_t\leftarrow \beta_1 \cdot \boldsymbol m_{t-1}+(1-\beta_1)\cdot \boldsymbol g_t$:Update biased first moment estimate \\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol  v_t\leftarrow \beta_2\cdot \boldsymbol v_{t-1}+(1-\beta_2)\cdot\boldsymbol g_t^2$:Update biased second moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\hat{\boldsymbol m_t}\leftarrow \boldsymbol m_t/(1-\beta_1^t)$: Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\hat{\boldsymbol v_t}\leftarrow \boldsymbol v_t/(1-\beta_2^t)$: Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol \theta_t=\boldsymbol \theta_{t-1}-\alpha\cdot \hat{\boldsymbol m_t}/(\sqrt{\hat{\boldsymbol v_t}+\epsilon}$: Update parameters\\
      End while
      Return $\boldsymbol \theta_t$ Result parameters
\item Defult setting:$\beta_1=0.9 \  \ \  \ \beta_2=0.999 \ \ \ \ \alpha=0.001\ \ \ \ \ \epsilon=10^{-8}$
\end{enumerate}

Notes: $g_{t}^t$ indicate the element-wise t power like $(g_t)^t$. Similarly, $\beta_{1}^t$ and $\beta_{2}^t$ also means the $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ to the power of $t$. In our case, we set the maximun time step $t=10000$ to decrease the computation.

Loss function: $$f=\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\frac{a}{1+exp(-b(t-c))})^2$$  
Gradient for parametrs a,b,c:
$$\nabla f(t,a)=\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2}-\frac{2y}{1+e^{(-bt+bc)}})$$
$$\nabla f(t,b)=-\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a^2e^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^3}+\frac{2ae^{(-bt+bc)}(c-t)y}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2})$$
$$\nabla f(t,c)=-\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a^2be^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^3}+\frac{2abe^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2})$$
The initail guess of a,b,c in each country: $a_0$=two times the cumulative case in 24 March, $b_0$=0.3, $c_0$=40. For some special countries for example China and South Korea, the intial guess are adjusted for many times and the iteration also increases.

## EM Algorithm

Cluster analysis is a method for finding clusters with similar characters within a dataset. And clustering methods can be divided into probability model-based approaches and nonparametric approaches[1]. The probability model-based approach contains Gussian Mixture Method, which assumes that the dataset follows a gussian mixture mixture distributions. 

Given that $\{\mathbf x_1,\mathbf x_2,...,\mathbf x_n \} \in \mathbb R^p$ be a collection of  $p$ dimensional data points. Assuming the following equation: 
$$x_i\sim
\begin{cases}
N(\boldsymbol \mu_1, \Sigma_1), \mbox{with probability }p_1 \\
N(\boldsymbol \mu_2, \Sigma_2), \mbox{with probability }p_2\\
\quad\quad\vdots\quad\quad,\quad\quad \vdots\\
N(\boldsymbol \mu_k, \Sigma_k), \mbox{with probability }p_k\\
\end{cases}
$$

$\sum_{j=1}^kp_j =1$

\vspace{10pt}

Let $\mathbf r_i = (r_{i,1},...,r_{i,k})\in \mathbb R^k$  as the cluster indicator of $\mathbf x_i$, which  takes form $(0, 0,...,0,1,0,0)$ with $r_{i,j} =I\{ \mathbf x_i\mbox{ belongs to  cluster } j\}$. The cluster indicator $\mathbf r_i$ is a latent variable that cannot be observed. What is complete likelihood of $(\mathbf x_i,\mathbf r_i)$. 

The distribution of $\mathbf r_i$ is $$f(\mathbf r_i) = \prod_{j= 1}^k p_j^{r_i,j}$$

The complete log-likelihood is 

$$\ell(\theta; \mathbf x,\mathbf r) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k r_{i,j} [\log p_i + \log  f(\mathbf x_i; \boldsymbol \mu_j, \Sigma_j)] = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k r_{i,j} [\log p_i-1/2\log|\Sigma|-1/2 (\mathbf x_i-\boldsymbol \mu_j)^\top\Sigma (\mathbf x_i-\boldsymbol \mu_j)]$$

**E-step** Evaluate the responsibilities using the current parameter values

$$\gamma_{i, k} ^{(t)}= P(r_{i,k}=1 |\mathbf x_i,  \theta^{(t)}) =  
\frac{p_k^{(t)}f(\mathbf x_i|\boldsymbol \mu_k^{(t)}, \Sigma_k^{(t)})}
{\sum_{j=1}^K f(\mathbf x_i|\boldsymbol \mu_j^{(t)}, \Sigma_j^{(t)})}$$

**M-step** 

$\theta^{(t+1)} = \arg\max\ell( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\gamma}^{(t)}, \theta )$.

Let $n_k = \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_{i, k}$, we have

$$\boldsymbol \mu_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_{i, k} \mathbf x_i$$
$$\Sigma_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_{i, k} (\mathbf x_i - \boldsymbol \mu_k^{(t+1)})(\mathbf x_i - \boldsymbol \mu_k^{(t+1)})^T$$

$$p_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{n_k}{n}$$

## K-mean

The $K$-means algorithm partitions data into $k$ clusters ($k$ is predetermined). We denote $\{\boldsymbol \mu_1, \boldsymbol \mu_2,...,\boldsymbol \mu_k\}$ as the  centers of the $k$ (unknown) clusters, and denote $\mathbf r_i = (r_{i,1},...,r_{i,k})\in \mathbb R^k$  as the ``hard'' cluster assignment of $\mathbf x_i$. 

$k$-means finds cluster centers and cluster assignments that minimize the objective function
$$J(\mathbf r, \boldsymbol \mu) = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^kr_{i,j}\|\mathbf x_i-\mu_k\|^2$$

K-means is a special case for Gussian Mixture. It is not required to consider small variances or the limit case of zero variances.

## Method to select number of clusters

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Elbow Method

Calculate the Within-Cluster-Sum of Squared Errors (WSS) for different values of k, and choose the k for which WSS becomes first starts to diminish.

\item The Silhouette Method

The silhouette value measures how similar a point is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).

\item Gap Statistic Method

The idea of the Gap Statistic is to compare the within-cluster dispersion to its expectation under an
appropriate null reference distribution.

\end{enumerate}

## Dunn Index

The Dunn index (DI) is a metric for evaluating clustering algorithms. It is an internal evaluation scheme, where the result is based on the clustered data itself. It aims to identify sets of clusters that are compact, with a small variance between members of the cluster, and well separated, where the means of different clusters are sufficiently far apart, as compared to the within cluster variance. For a given assignment of clusters, a higher Dunn index indicates better clustering. 


# Result

## Task 1

### Task 1.1

After applying the Adam algorithm in 116 countries, we get the estimated a,b,c values
for each country in \textbf{Table 1}. The maximum a value is 138340 from Italy.The b value ranges from 0.085(Singapore) to 3.857(Trinidad and Tobago).  The c value changes from 70 (China, Taiwan) to 4(Uzbekistan). 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/abc.jpg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
Table 1. Estimated a,b,c values in each country
\end{center}

Untill 24 March, It is estimaed that there are 27 countries that pass the  midpoint. They are : Belarus, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Denmark,Estonia, Guatemala, Honduras    , Iran, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea South, Liechtenstein, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Sweden,Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay,Uzbekistan, Venezuela.


If we define the cumulative cases at 24 March surpass the 80% of a value in corresponding country is "appraoching the end". Then there are 15 countries: Brunei, China, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Kazakhstan,Korea South, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela.

### Task 1.2

We select three kinds of countries to do the visualization: 1) In the very beginning stages of COVID-19 outbreak. Representatives: Afghanistan and Vietnam. 2) During the Outbreak stage. Representatives: UK and US. 3)Late stage of outbreak, which may produce a complete logistic curve. Representatives: China and South Korea. The a,b,c values of above 6 example countries are as follow:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/examples_abc.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Table 2. Estimated a,b,c values in 6 countries
\end{center}

The data from 25 March to 5 April (11 days) is used as test data to examine the predictivity of fitted model. The MSEs of training data(data before 24 March) and test data are as follow. Because the original data itself is relatively large, so the calculated MSE seems to be large.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/train_error.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Table 3. MSE of train data
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/test_error.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Table 4. MSE of test data
\end{center}

But if we visualize the model fitted value(red line) and observed values(train data is black and test data is blue). In the following plot, the fitted logistic curve fits the train data well, but deviations from test data in those two countries are different. The Afghanistan and Vietnam are both at the initial outbreak, so a dramatic increase of cases can be expected. 

The maximum cases(a=342) is expected to be reached around the 60th day in Afghanistan. The deviation of test data before around 1 April is smaller than that after 1 April. But the data in April 5, apparently exceeds the estimaed a value, which denote the bias of our fitted model since we built the model only based on the data before 24 March.

For Vietnam, the The maximum cases(a=418) is expected to be reached around the 120th day. The fitteness of both train and test data is good.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/AF_and_vie.jpeg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Figure 1. Afghanistan and Vietnam fitted and predicted values
\end{center}


In second kind country is as follow. The estimated a values are 16258 and 106991 for UK and US respectively.And the estimated stable stage when a is reach is 70th day and 50th day for UK and US respectively. For both of them, the red line fits black train data very well. But the increase of cases after 25 March is soaring, which is far away from the fitted line. To some extend, the \textbf{Figure 2} denotes the lack of predictivity beause the lack of data when we built the model.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/UK_and_US.jpeg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Figure 2. UK and US fitted and predicted values
\end{center}

In third kind country, who breakout reported at early Jan, their growths are very similar to each other. The problem of lack of predictivity re-appears that it estimates both of them already reached the end of spreading. But in fact both of them have increase cases after March 25. But the increase of cases is much slighter than UK and US. And the increase in China after 25 March is more flat given 1) it may already enters the stable part, which means the increase slows and 2) the interventions China takes may play an important role.

\end{center}


## Task 2

In order to choose the best clustering number, we use three different methods: The Elbow Method, The Silhouette Method and Gap Statistic Method. From the results (\textbf{Supplementay Fig. 1,2,3}), we finally choose three as our clustering number, given that when clustering number is five, there will be NA in GMM method.

\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/combined_class.jpg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Table 6: Cluster result of each country
\end{center}

The centering points of GMM and Kmeans method is shown in (\textbf{Table. 5}), and classification result of each country using these two method is shown in (\textbf{Table. 6}) and (\textbf{Fig. 4}). And the geographical distribution of countries in these classes using these two method can be seen in (\textbf{Fig. 5}), in which blue points are countries in class one, red points are countries in class two and yelloe points are countries in class three. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/combine.jpg}

\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/maps.jpeg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Figure 5: Clusters in map
\end{center}

To compare GMM and Kmeans method, we used Dunn Index method. From  (\textbf{Table. 7}), we can see that the Dunn Index of Kmeans is higher than that of GMM. The reason may be that our data don't follow Gussian distribution. So we choose Kmeans to cluster our character value of each country. From (\textbf{Fig.5}) and (\textbf{Table. 6}), we can see that Italy and US fall into class two, and China, France, Germany, etc fall into class three. The reason may be that Italy and US have higher growth rate and larger maximum cases value according to the given dataset. There is two types of countries in class three: one is that they have already arrived maximum point and their start time is relatively earlier than other countries, such as China and South Korea, another is that they are still in early stage and still lack of detection of covid-19, so their data may not be accurate and will increase quickly later due to more and more test, such as Spain and France.

# Discussion

## Task 1: 

For most regions, the logistic curve is a reasonable model for fitting the cumulative cases, capturing the growth rate trend. However, when it comes to predicting future new cases, the logistic growth model has limitations, especially for this dataset. For example, China and Korea are predicted to have reached the upper bound, but the predicted number of cases after March 23 exceeds the estimated maximum. For China, one possible explanation is that the imported cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia account for this increasing trend, but our model fails to include the fluence outside a certain region, assuming each region is independent. As for Korea, a potential second wave of infection may be the result of “returning to normal life” and some citizens’ ignoring social distancing. An alternative explanation is that the decreasing trend of growth rate based on the training data is attributed to Korea’s rapidly responding to and mitigating the spread of this epidemic, but the maximum has not yet been reached. Piecewise functions may be suitable for such cases. In Afghanistan, UK and US, the growth rate after March 23 is much larger than the predicted one, which may be explained by the absence and inefficiency of intervention strategies. Generally, we cannot add the effect of factors such as public health interventions, newly developed treatments and vaccinations, and other regions’ conditions outside a specific region, to this modeling process. Another factor needs to mention is that the data itself may not be accurate, that is the number of cases reported for a certain date may be smaller than the truth, as some cases may have not been tested or they may be tested falsely negative. 

Although the limitations of a logistic curve may account for the discrepancy between the fitted curve and the recorded number for some regions, it is still useful for prediction when the date is not far away from the latest date in the training data in most circumstances based on our test result. When the recorded number of cases significantly exceeds the prediction, it may be necessary to consider whether social factors such as improper interventions exist, and use this to guide future strategies for controlling this disease.

Several optimization algorithms were implemented when fitting the curve. The Newton–Raphson method was considered for its fast convergence rate. As it was not easy to calculate the hessian matrix of the RSS for the original form of the parametric function, we transformed y and a to be the inverse. However, the starting values for this algorithm have a significant impact on the result, as the Newton method tends to find the local minimizer instead of the global one, which is especially a severe problem for non-linear least squares regression. To reduce the effect of this limitation, we considered adding the momentum when doing iteration. The final algorithm chosen is Adam, as it adopts an adaptive per-coordinate learning rate selection method and dampens oscillations. Adam may lead to the optimal solution, however it needs a large number of iterations which exceeds our computer capacity, thus our fitting may not minimize the RSS, resulting in an inaccurate prediction.


## Task 2

According to Kmeans CLassification, we have three clusters in these countries with different maximum cases, growth rate and mid-point. But due to the inaccurate data in early stage of some countries, we may get inaccurate estimate of a, b, c value, which leads to wrong classification of some countries, such as Spain and France. And Kmeans clustering also has some disadvantages, one of them is that this method assumes the clusters as spherical, so does not work efficiently with complex geometrical shaped data.
