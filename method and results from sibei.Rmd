After applying the Adam algorithm in 116 countries, we get the estimated a,b,c values
for each country. The results are in Table 1. The maximum a value is 138340 from Italy.The b value ranges from 0.085(Singapore) to 3.857(Trinidad and Tobago).  The c value changes from 70 (China, Taiwan) to 4(Uzbekistan).
