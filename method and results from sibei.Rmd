# Method

## Adam

Adam is A Method for Stochastic Optimization proposed in 2015 from Diederik P Kingma that only need the first-order gradient. The Stochastic Gradient descent (SGD) is often used when the objective function is typically non-convex (as in our case). The "Ada" is derived from "adaptive", meaning this method change the learning rate over time according to gradients before. The detailed proof and explanation can be found in Diederik's paper. Here we just extracted the fake code part from original paper to clarify. 

Algorithm: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reqiured: $\alpha$: Stepsize \\ $\beta_1,\beta_2\in[0,1)$: Exponential decay rates for the moment estimates\\ $f(\boldsymbol\theta)$ : The objective function with parameter vetctor $\boldsymbol \theta$\\$\epsilon$ controls the converge
\item Required: $\boldsymbol\theta_0$: Initial guess of parameters \\
      $\mathbf m_0\leftarrow \mathbf0$: Initialize the 1st moment vector as $\mathbf 0$\\
      $\mathbf v_0\leftarrow \mathbf0$: Initialize the 1st moment vector as $\mathbf 0$\\
      $t\leftarrow0$:Initialize time step =0\\
      while $\boldsymbol\theta_t-\boldsymbol\theta_{t-1}>\epsilon$ not converge, do\\
         \ \ \ $t\leftarrow t+1$\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol g_t\leftarrow \nabla_{\theta}f_{t}(\boldsymbol\theta_{t-1})$: Get gradients w.r.t objective function at timestep $t$\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol  m_t\leftarrow \beta_1 \cdot \boldsymbol m_{t-1}+(1-\beta_1)\cdot \boldsymbol g_t$:Update biased first moment estimate \\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol  v_t\leftarrow \beta_2\cdot \boldsymbol v_{t-1}+(1-\beta_2)\cdot\boldsymbol g_t^2$:Update biased second moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\hat{\boldsymbol m_t}\leftarrow \boldsymbol m_t/(1-\beta_1^t)$: Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\hat{\boldsymbol v_t}\leftarrow \boldsymbol v_t/(1-\beta_2^t)$: Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate\\
         \ \ \ $\boldsymbol \theta_t=\boldsymbol \theta_{t-1}-\alpha\cdot \hat{\boldsymbol m_t}/(\sqrt{\hat{\boldsymbol v_t}+\epsilon}$: Update parameters\\
      End while
      Return $\boldsymbol \theta_t$ Result parameters
\item Defult setting:$\beta_1=0.9 \  \ \  \ \beta_2=0.999 \ \ \ \ \alpha=0.001\ \ \ \ \ \epsilon=10^{-8}$
\end{enumerate}

Notes: $g_{t}^t$ indicate the element-wise t power like $(g_t)^t$. Similarly, $\beta_{1}^t$ and $\beta_{2}^t$ also means the $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ to the power of $t$. In our case, we set the maximun time step $t=10000$ to decrease the computation.

Loss function: $$f=\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\frac{a}{1+exp(-b(t-c))})^2$$  
Gradient for parametrs a,b,c:
$$\nabla f(t,a)=\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2}-\frac{2y}{1+e^{(-bt+bc)}})$$
$$\nabla f(t,b)=-\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a^2e^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^3}+\frac{2ae^{(-bt+bc)}(c-t)y}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2})$$
$$\nabla f(t,c)=-\sum_{i=1}^n(\frac{2a^2be^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^3}+\frac{2abe^{(-bt+bc)}}{(1+e^{(-bt+bc)})^2})$$
The initail guess of a,b,c in each country: $a_0$=two times the cumulative case in 24 May, $b_0$=0.3, $c_0$=40. For some special countries for example China and South Korea, the intial guess are adjusted for many times and the iteration also increases.

# Results

## Task 1.1

After applying the Adam algorithm in 116 countries, we get the estimated a,b,c values
for each country in Table 1. The maximum a value is 138340 from Italy.The b value ranges from 0.085(Singapore) to 3.857(Trinidad and Tobago).  The c value changes from 70 (China, Taiwan) to 4(Uzbekistan).

\begin{center}
Table 1. Estimated a,b,c values in each country
\end{center}

Untill 24 May, It is estimaed that there are 27 countries that pass the  midpoint. They are : Belarus, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Denmark,Estonia, Guatemala, Honduras    , Iran, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea South, Liechtenstein, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Sweden,Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay,Uzbekistan, Venezuela.


If we define the cumulative cases at 24 May surpass the 80% of a value in corresponding country is "appraoching the end". Then there are 15 countries: Brunei, China, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Kazakhstan,Korea South, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela.

## Task 1.2

We select three kinds of countries to do the visualization: 1) The early stages of COVID-19 outbreak, no deliberate intervention implemented. Representatives: Afghanistan and Vietnam. 2) Outbreak stage, the government intervention hasn't come into effect. Representatives: UK and US. 3)After the outbreak and the govrnment interventions have been effective. Representatives: China and South Korea. The a,b,c values of above 6 example countries are as follow:

\end{center}

The data from 25 May to 5 April (11 days) is used as test data to examine the predictivity of fitted model. The MSEs of training data(data before 24 May) and test data are as follow. Because the original data itself is relatively large, so the calculated MSE seems to be large.

\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./Plots/test_error.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Table 4. MSE of test data
\end{center}

But if we visualize the model fitted value(red line) and observed values(train data is black and test data is blue). In the following plot, the fitted logistic curve fits the train data well, but deviations from test data in those two countries are different. The Afghanistan and Vietnam are both at the initial outbreak, so a dramatic increase of cases can be expected. 

The maximum cases(a=342) is expected to be reached around the 60th day in Afghanistan. The deviation of test data before around 1 April is smaller than that after 1 April. But the data in April 5, apparently exceeds the estimaed a value, which denote the bias of our fitted model since we built the model only based on the data before 24 May.

For Vietnam, the The maximum cases(a=418) is expected to be reached around the 120th day. The fitteness of both train and test data is good.

In second kind country is as follow. The estimated a values are 16258 and 106991 for UK and US respectively.And the estimated stable stage when a is reach is 70th day and 50th day for UK and US respectively. For both of them, the red line fits black train data very well. But the increase of cases after 25 May is soaring, which is far away from the fitted line. To some extend, the Figure 2 denotes the lack of predictivity beause the lack of data when we built the model.

\end{center}

In third kind country, who breakout reported at early Jan, their growths are very similar to each other. Old problem of fitted model re-appears that it estimates both of them already reached the end of spreading. But in fact both of them is undering increase cases after May 25. But the increase of cases is much slighter than UK and US. And the increase in China after 25 May is more flat given 1) it may already enters the stable part, which means the increase slows and 2) the interventions China takes may paly an important role.
